<p>When sending a reply to a valid “message.<msgid>@messages.netsuite.com” address, I discovered something interesting. <a href="http://netsuite.com/">NetSuite</a> uses these addresses to store a copy of the message with the order, then forwards the message along to the real destination. However, the forwarding method is busted.</p>

<p>It translates the headers in the original message. I sent:</p>

<pre><code>From: Ian Gulliver &lt;ian@penguinhosting.net&gt;
To: “George Sasson (PAA)” &lt;messages.&lt;msgid&gt;@messages.netsuite.com&gt;
Cc: ian-djmart@penguinhosting.net
</code></pre>

<p>It internally translated this to:</p>

<pre><code>From: ian@penguinhosting.net
To: george@proaudioamerica.com
Cc: ian-djmart@penguinhosting.net
</code></pre>

<p>It then passed the message to its outgoing mail program, which <strong>reparsed the headers</strong>. In this case, it means that I got two copies of the message; one from my local MTA because of the CC, and one back from NetSuite because of the CC.</p>

<p><a href="http://prolixium.com/">prox</a> helped me test this; it works when the CC isn’t coming back to the same host. That means it’s a valid relay method.</p>
