<p>I went looking for an HTTP/2 replacement for <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html">Ab</a> and found <a href="https://nghttp2.org/documentation/h2load-howto.html">h2load</a>. Perfect, awesome, just what I need. My first few test runs work fine, then as I'm ramping up test size...</p>

<pre><code>Process Request Failure:1
</code></pre>

<p>That number at the end seems to be the number of failed requests. Tellingly, it happened after exactly 1000 successful requests each time. Restart h2load, get another 1000 successful requests. I tried <code>keepalive_requests</code> in my nginx config, but no luck. Finally, after going through the nginx source for instances of "1000", I found <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_requests"><code>http2_max_requests</code></a>, which defaults to 1000. Increase that to an enormous number, restart nginx, everything works fine.</p>

<p>Someone should really implement reconnect in h2load, or at least some decent error messages.</p>
