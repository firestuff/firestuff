<p>We’ve still got a bunch of 1 and 2U servers in Equinix. I’ve been cycling out older hardware lately, so I’ve ended up carrying these around alot. I had this wonderful idea for carrying several of them at a time, around areas where a handcart is just a pain. What you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://www.pctote.com/">PC Tote</a> (I don’t know where you can still buy these, but making one shouldn’t be too hard)</li>
<li>Two <a href="http://www.ems.com/catalog/product_detail_square.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442583117&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302875262&amp;bmUID=1151679948198">large locking carabiners</a></li>
<li>An empty backpack with nice strong straps</li>
</ul>

<p>Put them together, you get this:</p>

<p>It still has the handle on top, so you can switch to carrying it easily.</p>
