<p>Previous generations of "where the flamingcow roams" have existed on Blogger and Medium, but have been dormant for some time. Tired of my posts there being "decorated" by the hosting provider without approval and inspired by <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/bloated/index.html">Fabien Sanglard</a>, I'm rebooting here.</p>

<p>Posts prior to this one are copied from Blogger or Medium. Forgive me for all their historical naivet√©. Posts after this are new here, and I'm sure will look equally silly in ten years. The historical posts have been hand-translated to markdown and likely contain translation errors.</p>
