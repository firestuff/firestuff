<p>This is more a curiosity question than a problem. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir temp
cd temp
seq 1 30000 | xargs touch
ls -lhd .
find . -type f | xargs rm
ls -lhd .
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this on ext3 shows a 432k directory that stays that size even after the files are removed. It appears that ext3 practices lazy deletion, leaving the directory structures intact. It probably assumes that a directory that was large once will be large again, so it can save the allocation expense in the future.</p>
