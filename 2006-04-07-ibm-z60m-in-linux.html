<p>I picked up a new IBM Z60m laptop at work. Here’s the rundown from trying to install Debian:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forget Sarge; it doesn’t support the wired or wireless network cards or the hard disk controller.</li>
<li>Forget the <a href="http://kmuto.jp/b.cgi/debian/d-i-2615.htm">Sarge+2.6.15</a> image with the internal CD-ROM drive; it doesn’t support it, though it finds the hard drive and the wired ethernet.</li>
<li>Since I don’t have the 2.6.15 image on my USB drive, I pulled out the USB CD-ROM and installed from that.</li>
<li>If you let the Debian installer partition for you, it leaves the 4.5GB restore partition. If you don’t want this, partition manually.</li>
<li>After it installs, you’ll want to add the following your /etc/modules:
<ul>
<li>radeonfb</li>
<li>cpufreq_userspace</li>
<li>speedstep_centrino</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The console framebuffer comes out to a whopping 210×65 characters (1600×1050 pixels).</li>
<li>Install powernowd to get the CPU scaling working properly.</li>
<li>At 800mhz (the lowest SpeedStep) with the screen dimmed all the way, the battery gets about 3h:30m.</li>
<li>You’ll need to put firmware for the IPW2200 driver in /lib/firmware; you can get it <a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">here</a>.</li>
<li>X is a real pain to get working. The ATI driver doesn’t seem to know about this card. The only way I managed was to disable the “dri” module and use the “fbdev” driver; I had to add an “fbset -depth 32″ at startup to get the color depth right.</li>
<li>The CD-ROM/DVD drive is also a real trip. Edit /etc/mkinitramfs/modules and add:
<ul>
<li>libata atapi_enabled=1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then dpkg-reconfigure your kernel image module (”dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-2.6.16-1-686″ for me).</li>
<li>This will let you mount CDs, but doesn’t seem to support the raw access needed by libdvdcss2.  I still can’t play DVDs with this drive.  libata ATAPI support is under active development, so hopefully this will clean up soon.</li>
</ul>
