<p>Guitar Center had <a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/product?sku=241710">these</a> on sale cheap, and I couldn’t resist. It claimed to be “class compliant” on the box for 2 channel input and 4 channel output at 16-bit/48khz, so I figured it was worth a try.</p>

<p>Much to my amazement, it actually works. At least, mostly. I get the following in /sys/class/sound:</p>

<pre><code>adsp
audio
controlC0
dmmidi
dsp
midi
midiC0D0
mixer
pcmC0D0p
pcmC0D1c
pcmC0D1p
</code></pre>

<p>mplayer can play to both stereo output channels on the device, but only at 16-bit/44.1khz, as far as I can tell:</p>

<pre><code>mplayer -ao alsa:device=hw=0.0

mplayer -ao alsa:device=hw=0.1
</code></pre>

<p>Both streams work at once (the headphone stream switch button on the front is really nice), and it sounds great!</p>
