<p>So, I took some friends to <a href="http://iflysfbay.com/">iFlySFBay</a> the other evening. We had a great time and they gave us a DVD. It's certainly not the awesomest format to share with your friends, so I used <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">HandBrake</a> to rip it to h264. Next up: how do I easily share it?</p>

<p>I started with <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a>. Upload was nice and easy but there's no playback UI; you're stuck with your browser UI, which is pretty lousy in <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>, but works: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13482590/iFLY.m4v">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13482590/iFLY.m4v</a></p>

<p>Next up: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore">Amazon Cloud Drive</a>. Hold on, what, no sharing?</p>

<p>Then: <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/">PicasaWeb</a>. 1 GB size limit?!?</p>

<p>OK, I guess I'll fall back to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, since they removed the video length limit. "Failed (unable to convert video file)." Chrome can play it but YouTube can't decode it?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>: 1 GiB/20 minute limit.</p>

<p>This really should not be a hard problem. It's a compressed version of a 30 minute movie. Why is this so difficult?</p>
