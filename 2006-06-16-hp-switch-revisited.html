<p>Awhile back, I posted a <a href="2006-03-21-hp-procurve-2824-mini-review.html">mini-review</a> of an HP switch that I’d gotten on demo. I had the switch for about 5 days, then shipped it back. A month later, HP starts emailing and eventually sending letters demanding the switch back. Attempts to explain the situation didn’t get me anywhere. The letters contained pre-paid shipping labels, so we thought that we’d add a little humor:</p>
