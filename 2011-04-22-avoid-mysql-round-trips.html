<p>100ms (e.g. cross-US) latency to your MySQL server? Running 100,000 statements? That's 3 hours of overhead before you even get to your statement runtime on the server. Quick hack:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; delimiter |
mysql&gt; select 1;
 -&gt; select 2;
 -&gt; |
+---+
| 1 |

1 row in set (0.00 sec)

| 2 |

1 row in set (0.00 sec)
