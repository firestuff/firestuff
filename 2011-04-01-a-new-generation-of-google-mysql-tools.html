<p>When I started at Google, the MySQL team had a moderate open source presence. The largest part was the Google server patches for 4.0, 5.0 and some starter work on 5.1. There was also a small set of tools: mypgrep, mstat and some others. Chip Turner, who did the tools releases, had already moved to another team, and we haven't released new tools since.</p>

<p>I'm now happy to announce a new round of tool releases. We're just getting started, but here's what's available so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-mysql-tools/source/browse/trunk/pylib/db.py">db.py</a>: Easily execute queries in parallel on a sharded database</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-mysql-tools/source/browse/trunk/sql.py">sql.py</a>: Interactive shell to db.py</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-mysql-tools/source/browse/trunk/permissions.py">permissions.py</a>: Manage MySQL permissions in a Python-based format</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-mysql-tools/source/browse/trunk/validate.py">validate.py</a>: Parse SQL using pyparsing and apply rules with live DB data</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the actual tools being used to run MySQL at scale inside Google, not one-time sanitized copies. You can get them at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-mysql-tools/">http://code.google.com/p/google-mysql-tools/</a>. The old tools and patches are still available in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-mysql-tools/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fold">old/</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to the whole team for their work on these tools and especially to Razvan Musaloiu-E. for handling release code reviews.
