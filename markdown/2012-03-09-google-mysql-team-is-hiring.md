Do you know MySQL inside and out? Do you have experience running it production? Have you dared to look at the code? Maybe even patched it? Google's MySQL team would love to speak to you. We're hiring several software engineers in Mountain View, CA, USA to primarily work on MySQL server improvements, contributing to Google's [open source MySQL branch](http://code.google.com/p/google-mysql/). In addition to feature work, Google MySQL developers work closely with operations-focused engineers tracking down bugs and solving tricky performance problems, at truly enormous scale.
