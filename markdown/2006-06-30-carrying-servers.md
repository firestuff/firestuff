We’ve still got a bunch of 1 and 2U servers in Equinix. I’ve been cycling out older hardware lately, so I’ve ended up carrying these around alot. I had this wonderful idea for carrying several of them at a time, around areas where a handcart is just a pain. What you’ll need:

* A [PC Tote](http://www.pctote.com/) (I don’t know where you can still buy these, but making one shouldn’t be too hard)
* Two [large locking carabiners](http://www.ems.com/catalog/product_detail_square.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442583117&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302875262&bmUID=1151679948198)
* An empty backpack with nice strong straps

Put them together, you get this:

It still has the handle on top, so you can switch to carrying it easily.
