So, I took some friends to [iFlySFBay](http://iflysfbay.com/) the other evening. We had a great time and they gave us a DVD. It's certainly not the awesomest format to share with your friends, so I used [HandBrake](http://handbrake.fr/) to rip it to h264. Next up: how do I easily share it?

I started with [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/). Upload was nice and easy but there's no playback UI; you're stuck with your browser UI, which is pretty lousy in [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), but works: [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13482590/iFLY.m4v](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13482590/iFLY.m4v)

Next up: [Amazon Cloud Drive](https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore). Hold on, what, no sharing?

Then: [PicasaWeb](https://picasaweb.google.com/). 1 GB size limit?!?

OK, I guess I'll fall back to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/), since they removed the video length limit. "Failed (unable to convert video file)." Chrome can play it but YouTube can't decode it?

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/): 1 GiB/20 minute limit.

This really should not be a hard problem. It's a compressed version of a 30 minute movie. Why is this so difficult?
