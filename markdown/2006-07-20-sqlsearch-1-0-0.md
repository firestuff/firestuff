After getting tired of waiting for the MySQL folks to [add features](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=14521) to FULLTEXT and to [make it work on InnoDB](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=13979), I decided to do it myself. I’ve just finished [sqlsearch 1.0.0](files/sqlsearch-1.0.0.tar.bz2). Features:

* ENGINE-independent (requires triggers)
* Uses fast, full-word indexed searching
* Multi-table and multi-column indexes supported
* Supports “quoted strings” and +/- logical operators in search queries
* Gives search query feedback, including why some terms were ignored
* Provides typo and phonetic suggestions for words which don’t appear in the index
* Supports weighting of “sources” (tables or fields) and “ids” (rows)
* Supports link information between objects to provide additional search context
* Licensed under the GPL
* Comes with a howto document to help integrating it into your codebase

If you use it and have any brilliant ideas on improving the search algorithm or for additional features, please let me know.
